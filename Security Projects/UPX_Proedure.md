# Step-by-Step Procedure for using the UPX Executable Packer Tool

## Short Introduction

UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables) is a tool used to compress or "pack" executable files, reducing their size without changing functionality. It's widely used for distributing applications and is also common in malware analysis, as many malware authors use UPX to obfuscate their executables.

## Installation

Download UPX from the official UPX GitHub: [UPX: the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables - Homepage](https://github.com/upx/upx)

Navigate to the folder where UPX is located on Windows PowerShell.

Run `./upx --version` to verify installation.

## Packing an Executable

Start by selecting an Executable File - Choose any executable file path (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe`) that you want to pack.

Compress the Executable - In PowerShell, run `UPX C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe`.

The executable file will be compressed, and UPX will display the original and compressed sizes, along with the percentage of reduction.

To further verify it is compressed - Run `ls C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe | Select-Object Name, Length` command before and after the UPX compression to compare the file size.

## Unpacking an Executable Using UPX

Select an Executable File that has been packed using UPX - Choose any executable file path (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe`) that you want to unpack.

Unpack the Compressed Executable File - In PowerShell, run `upx -d C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe`.

The executable file will be decompressed, and UPX will display the compressed and decompressed sizes, along with the percentage of reduction.

To further verify it is compressed - Run `ls C:\Users\user\Desktop\sample.exe` command before and after the UPX compression to compare the file size.
